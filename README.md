## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### Main Converter (WeasyPrint)
- Uses WeasyPrint engine for HTML to PDF conversion
- Applies custom CSS for single-page layout
- Handles fonts and styling accurately
- Better support for modern CSS features

### Alternative Converter (pdfkit)
- Uses wkhtmltopdf engine via pdfkit
- Injects additional CSS for layout optimization
- Good fallback option if WeasyPrint has issues
- Requires separate wkhtmltopdf installation

### CSS Optimizations Applied
- Font sizes reduced to 4-7px range for content density
- Grid layout changed to 4 columns for better space utilization
- Margins and padding minimized throughout
- Image heights reduced to 55-60px
- Transform scaling applied for fine-tuning

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Python is not installed or not in PATH"**
- Install Python from python.org
- Make sure to check "Add Python to PATH" during installation
- Restart your command prompt/terminal after installation

**"weasyprint installation failed"**
- Try installing Visual C++ Build Tools
- Use the alternative converter instead
- On some systems, try: `pip install --only-binary=all weasyprint`

**"wkhtmltopdf not found"**
- Download and install wkhtmltopdf from the official website
- Make sure the installation directory is added to your system PATH
- Restart your command prompt after installation

**"Images not showing in PDF"**
- Make sure all image files (PNG) are in the same directory as the HTML file
- Check that image file names match exactly (case-sensitive)

**"Content is cut off or too small"**
- The scripts are optimized for A4 paper size
- If using different paper size, you may need to adjust the CSS scaling values
- Try printing at 100% scale (not "Fit to page")

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:
1. Check that all image files are present in the directory
2. Ensure Python and pip are properly installed
3. Try the alternative converter if the main one fails
4. Check the console output for specific error messages
